If #include <stdio.h> is removed when the program calls printf, the program would fail during compilation stage. The header <stdio.h> contains the declaration for printf function, and tells the compiler about the function's return type and types of its arguments. Without it, the compiler encounters an undeclared function.
The failing stage is Linking and the expected error message is "undefined reference to printf" from the linker.
