This repository contains all my programs and answers for Homework6.
Each C program is stored in its own file under the name questionN.c where N is a number from 1 to 25.
Text answers are in .txt files, and screenshots of compilation/output are stored in the screenshots/ folder.

How to compile my programs:
I used GCC to compile any question: gcc questionN.c -o questionN or I also used gcc questionN.c -o qN
After that I used ./questionN or ./qN respectively to run them.
